- 2011 will be the year, when we should see roll-out of HSPA networks in major cities, towns by the private mobile operators and that should help in ubiquitous mobile internet access - to start with in cherry picked locations! India is deploying 3G networks when we have > 700 Million mobile connections already and that means quite a large no. of  terminals are 3G read

y. But we need to see how the mobile operators innovate wrt affordable 3G data plans, which is a MUST for a decent adoption else it will remain the way EDGE/GPRS has fared till no

w. Till such time, we should WiFi offload the mobile internet traffic from Smartphone when we access from our Home

s. We need to ensure that we set the mobile browser setting as below: \[gallery order="DESC" orderby="ID"\]
- iPad, Tablets, Kindle should find lot of  traction.
- Expect a lot of buzz around India specific apps - stock trading, e-tickets, Bank payments ....
- Video calling - probably India will show the world how to market this feature effectively and take it to the users who are in the bottom of the ARPU pyramid.

Exciting times are ahead and in the meanwhile please do NOT 'death grip' your phones! and have a funfilled 2011. Cheers: -)
