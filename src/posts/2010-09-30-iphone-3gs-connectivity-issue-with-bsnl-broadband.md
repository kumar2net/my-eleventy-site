I was involved in remote troubleshooting ofÂ  iPhone NOT connecting to the newly installed BSNL Router (Type 2 ADSL modem in BSNL parlance, make - Teracom) while the laptop would connect instantly. The following worked:

-   configured wireless settings for WPA - mixed mode with passphrase (instead of WEP 64 bit key, as done by the BSNL technician)
-   WPA and WPA2 encryption protocols are newer, more effective security options for wireless networks than the older WEP protocol and hence the new generation devices work better with it.
