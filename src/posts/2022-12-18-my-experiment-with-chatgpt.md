Artificial Intelligence & Deep learning has taken a giant Leap indeed and I am enthralled experimenting with ChatGPT. What's CHATGPT? In it's third version GPT-3, or the third generation Generative Pre-trainedTransformer, is a neural network machine learning model trained using internet data to generate any type of text. Developed by OpenAl - Elon Musk is the co-founder, it requires a small amount of input text to generate large volumes of relevant and sophisticated machine- generated text
