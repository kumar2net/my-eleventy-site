The action starts with the auctioning of 3G spectrum. Some stats: - India has 23 Telecom Circles - Metros (4), A Circle (5), B Circle (8) and C Circles (6) - You can bid for one 5MHz carrier only (5+5 MHz) - 1920-1980 MHz paired with 2110-2170 MH

z. It will interesting to see how the 3G operators are going to push the maximum limit of Shannon's Law to achieve decent n

o. of concurrent users per sector + throughput per user (hope some multiples above the existing 384 kbps/sector throughput of EGDE and 140 kbps/sector ofÂ  GPRS networks) which will determine the success of 3G in Indi

a. 3G is being touted as the last straw to pull the country forward wrt Internet penetration as growth in Broadband using existing Copper lines (ADSL) seem to have plateaue

d. Only ~ 5 Million Broadband connections out of available ~ 35 Million Cu lines (BSNL, MTNL and Airtel) buried undergroun

d.
- Shannon's law defines the theoretical maximum rate at which error-free digits can be transmitted over a bandwidth-limited channel in the presence of noise
