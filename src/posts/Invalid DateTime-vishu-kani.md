<p>With Guruvayoorappn songs casting on Android TV - Panchajanyam by Unni Menon and viewing Kani was surreal.  The amount of  passion and eye for detail that goes into  decking up Krishna is awesome </p>

<p>Very good Lunch spread indeed- Capsicum, drumstick Sambhar,  lady finger aka Okra curry, Dhall payasam, Vada,  papad &amp;  Vadu manga pickle and I binged on it </p>

<p>After a solid nap,  we went and hired a court in an indoor shuttle badminton facility and played for around 40 minutes.  Sweated it out in the Evening and I hit 16 zone minutes in Fitbit</p>

<p>Wound off the evening with a delicious Pav Bhaaji at Hotel Gopal - the अड्डा adda of our budding BDS aspirant</p>
