I love the vibrant colours & artistic quality of Indian craftsmen on display here- Venue Kalashetra grounds, Thiruvanmiyur

A Sunday Evening well spent, parking lots at full capacity and frayed tempers because of that. Flea market has its origins in used stuff sale, garage or yard sale or in India it's Choori ka maal - stolen stuff but here it's all new stuff 💯 percent

Women folk spend a lot of time at handloom dress material shops while I see men carry broom sticks, floor moppers, fan blade dust cleaners - advanced types 😊

My favourite is wood doll shops

Of course enough food stalls - spring potato 🥔 something new i see these days. Cut like a spring, fried in oil & cheese or hot sauce topping. Sugarcane juice, jigarthanda, Delhi appalam, chat were all there

The type of dust mats, floor mats ஜமுக்காளம் beautifully woven

Cast iron kitchen utensils are fad these days - retro

Consume iron involuntarily when you cook food using these
