<p>At Gurukripa Heritage hotel, Thirussur</p>

<p>It's &gt; 100 years old and the teak wood ceiling planks, wall panels and the way they had modernised the bathroom fittings with jaguar is fantastic. It's closer to the major temples and to the railway station too. Women folk a word of caution - do NOT ring the bell in Kerala temples - lest you will get yelled at ðŸ“¢</p>
