<p>Solid Propulsion, Liquid Propulsion, Cryogenic engines are some technical stuff I could relate to. That Madhavan R had taken this kind of subject and directed it too deserves a lot of appreciation </p>

<p>We got stuck in a massive traffic snarl near Perur when getting back home and had to navigate through narrow lanes to get around the vehicle pileups </p>
