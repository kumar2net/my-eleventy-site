I tested Cothas coffee after seeing an ad in the telly a few months ago and it had a lovely aroma. It is a 85-15 blend of Coffee & Chicory. My assumption all along is - chicory gives the filter coffee thickness and we add just a few percent. I think it's been a practice for a long time.

But when they launched a speciality coffee blend recently with 47% chicory, it kind of shook me ðŸ¤¦ and I wonder is it really coffee at all?
