It is impressive to note that the net month-on-month mobile addition (connections) now clock 9 Million per month in India:

GSM + CDMA = 305.23 Million connections

Wireline (landline) = 38.63 Million connections.

While the Voice part of the mobile business is doing good, things aren't looking good on the Data front. Only 3% of mobile user base have subscribed for data (mobile internet and open garden ). I am sure the following mix of network and content will help advance the case for mobile internet in India:
<ul>
	<li>3G networks - HSPA/WCDMA/LTE to boost capacity per base station</li>
	<li>quality mobile specific content</li>
	<li>vibrant eco-system where-in the mobile operator gives majority of the revenue share ( &gt; 80%) for mobile specific content to the developer</li>
</ul>
