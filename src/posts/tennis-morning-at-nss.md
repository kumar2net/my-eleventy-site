<p>Good workout at National Sports School, Ajjanoor, Vadavalli today. The drive is a bit longer but that's the nearest I could find after a lot of googling and cold calling. The coach Muthu fed a good amount of balls for mid court, baseline rallies and volley practise for 20 odd minutes </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then I paired up with Coach and played a very competitive set of doubles with Divyesh &amp; Jayvanth. I opened up my can of fresh Yonex balls. They said these are more suited for hard courts &amp; are recommending Dunlop AO for clay court. With the bit of monsoon rains the courts wore a settled look </p>

<p>Jayvanth was hitting forehands at damn good speeds, loaded with heavy topspin and closer to net. Once I got used to his speed,  I was able to volley back at him and won some good points too. We lost closely 6-6 ( tiebreak 8-6 )</p>

<p>There is a doubles tournament - organised by NSS is coming up next weekend and since I am new here - coach Gopi said he will pair me up with a good player. Also achieved my target zone minutes &gt;23 and I am sure Chitra will be happy </p>

<p>So much nostalgia when I watched on Live TV, some TNPL matches ( Tamilnadu IPL ) being played at India cements ground at Sankar nagar, Thirunelveli 627357. The pincode is etched in my memory forever<em> ♾️</em> </p>
