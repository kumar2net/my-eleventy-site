Nice to have had a brilliant Vishu Kani yesterday and lots of good memories from young

![Vishu Kani]

 Grand Vishu Kani

With Guruvayoorappn songs casting on Android TV - Panchajanyam by Unni Menon and viewing Kani was surreal. The amount of passion and eye for detail that goes into decking up Krishna is awesome

 Very good Lunch spread indeed- Capsicum, drumstick Sambhar, lady finger aka Okra curry, Dhall payasam, Vada, papad & Vadu manga pickle and I binged on it

After a solid nap, we went and hired a court in an indoor shuttle badminton facility and played for around 40 minutes. Sweated it out in the Evening and I hit 16 zone minutes in Fitbit

Wound off the evening with a delicious Pav Bhaaji at Hotel Gopal - the अड्डा adda of our budding BDS aspirant
