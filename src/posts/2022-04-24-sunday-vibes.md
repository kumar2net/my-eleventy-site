Saravanan and self were the only ones on time - 6.30 am at court today. Abhi, Venki, Kaushik, Krish & Ganesh made up the list of 7. One drop out this week too

Abhi opened up a fresh can of Slazenger Championship balls and I woke up Venki from slumber with an acute drop shot - haven't seen him sprint like that. He tried an immediate revenge drop. Abhi played front court partnering with me and that's good to see as I always believe that decent volley play will make his game go up a notch. We lost 6-4 but we did reasonably well. I am gradually picking up steam and will improve in coming weeks

With the effervescent Kaushik

Kaushik looked jaded - maybe last evening dinner 🥣🥗 tired him out

Abhi's new possession Babolat Pure Aero Rafa looks gorgeous
