<p>Artificial Intelligence &amp; Deep learning has taken a giant Leap indeed and I am enthralled experimenting with ChatGPT. What's CHATGPT? In it's third version GPT-3, or the third generation Generative Pre-trainedTransformer, is a neural network machine learning model trained using internet data to generate any type of text. Developed by OpenAl - Elon Musk is the co-founder, it requires a small amount of input text to generate large volumes of relevant and sophisticated machine- generated text</p>

<p>It  replied as follows:<br /><br />Farming in Madampatti Village<br /><br />Madampatti village, located in the state of Tamil Nadu in India, is a small agricultural community that relies heavily on farming for their livelihood. The village is situated in a fertile region with rich soil and a favorable climate, which makes it ideal for growing a variety of crops.<br /><br />One of the main crops grown in Madampatti village is rice, which is a staple food in the region. Rice is typically grown during the monsoon season, when the fields are flooded with water. The village is also home to many small-scale farmers who grow other crops such as vegetables, grains, and legumes.<br /><br />In addition to traditional crops, Madampatti village is also home to several livestock farms. These farms raise animals such as cows, goats, and chickens, which provide a source of milk, meat, and eggs for the village.<br /><br />Farming in Madampatti village is not without its challenges, however. Drought and irregular rainfall can affect crop yields, and pests and diseases can also take a toll on crops. To combat these issues, many farmers in the village use modern agricultural techniques such as irrigation and pest control methods to ensure a healthy harvest.<br /><br />Despite these challenges, farming remains an important part of the Madampatti village economy and culture. The village is home to a strong agricultural community that works together to support each other and ensure a successful harvest.<br /><br />Overall, Madampatti village is a thriving agricultural community that is deeply rooted in tradition and dedicated to preserving the art of farming.</p>

<p>Write a polite but strong letter that I didn't like that comment by my friend<br /><br />Dear [Friend],<br /><br />I hope this letter finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you about something that has been weighing on my mind.<br /><br />I recently saw a comment that you made, and I have to say that I was quite disappointed by it. The comment you made was not only inappropriate, but it was also hurtful and offensive.<br /><br />I understand that we all make mistakes, and I do not want to hold this against you. However, I do want to express my strong feelings about this issue and let you know that comments like this are not acceptable to me.<br /><br />I value our friendship and I hope that we can move past this and continue to support and respect each other. I hope that in the future, you will think more carefully about the words you use and the impact they may have on others.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />[Your Name]</p>
