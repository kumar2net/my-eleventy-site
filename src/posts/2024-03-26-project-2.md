# Building a Modern Blog with Eleventy and AI

In this project, I'm documenting my experience building a modern blog using Eleventy (11ty) and integrating AI tools to enhance the development process. This post will serve as a comprehensive guide and reflection on the journey

## Project Goals
- Create a fast, modern blog using Eleventy
- Implement AI-assisted development workflow
- Document the process and share learnings
- Build a maintainable and scalable content structure

## Content Creation with AI

### Story Example: "The Tale of Kumar, Babu, and the Two Lions"
As part of this project, I explored AI-assisted content creation. Here's a summary of a story created with AI assistance:

**Main Elements:**
- Two friends (Kumar and Babu) in Thirunelveli
- Two magical lions (Raja and Rani) with special abilities
- A dramatic rescue during a cyclone
- Themes of friendship, courage, and community

**Key Features:**
- Bilingual content (English and Tamil)
- Cultural integration
- Magical realism elements
- Local landmarks and traditions

This story demonstrates how AI can help create engaging, culturally rich content while maintaining authenticity and local flavor.

## Technical Stack
- **Static Site Generator**: Eleventy (11ty)
- **Development Tools**: 
  - Cursor AI for intelligent code assistance
  - Git for version control
  - Node.js for package management
- **Deployment**: Netlify for continuous deployment

## Implementation Details

### Site Structure
The blog follows a clean, organized structure:
```
src/
├── posts/         # Blog posts in Markdown
