<p>A Sunday Evening well spent, parking lots at full capacity and frayed tempers because of that. Flea market has its origins in used stuff sale, garage or yard sale or in India it's Choori ka maal - stolen stuff but here it's all new stuff 💯 percent</p>

<p>Women folk spend a lot of time at handloom dress material shops while I see men carry broom sticks, floor moppers, fan blade dust cleaners  - advanced types 😊</p>
