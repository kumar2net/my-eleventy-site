# My Journey with Cursor AI and Modern Web Development

I'm excited to share my experience with modernizing my development workflow using AI-powered tools and static site generators. This project represents a significant shift in how I approach web development and content creation.

## Project Overview
After following the developments in AI and development tools, particularly through Build and Google I/O speeches, I decided to modernize my development workflow. The goal was to create a more efficient and enjoyable coding experience while maintaining a modern, fast-loading website.

## Technical Setup Details

### Development Environment
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Latest Long Term Support)
- **Code Editor**: Cursor AI (Linux x86 AppImage)
  - Launch Configuration: Using `--no-sandbox` option for compatibility
  - AI Features: Code completion, refactoring suggestions, and natural language processing
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub integration

### Eleventy Configuration
```javascript
// .eleventy.js
module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {
    // Asset handling
    eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy("src/assets");
    eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy("src/css");

    // Custom date formatting
    eleventyConfig.addFilter("dateReadable", date => {
        return date.toLocaleDateString('en-US', {
            year: 'numeric',
            month: 'long',
            day: 'numeric'
        });
    });

    // Directory structure
    return {
        dir: {
            input: "src",
            output: "_site",
            includes: "_includes",
            layouts: "_layouts"
        },
        templateFormats: ["md", "njk", "html"]
    };
};
```

### Project Structure
```

│   ├── _includes/     # Reusable components
│   ├── _layouts/      # Page templates

└── .eleventy.js      # Eleventy configuration
```

## Key Features
- AI-Powered Development: Integrated Cursor AI as my primary code editor, bringing intelligent code suggestions and automated tasks to my workflow
- Static Site Generation: Migrated to Eleventy (11ty) for better performance and simpler content management
- Modern Development Workflow: Implemented automated deployment and version control practices

## Technical Implementation
I chose the following technologies for this project:
- Cursor AI: An AI-powered code editor that helps with code completion, debugging, and development tasks
- Eleventy (11ty): A simpler static site generator that converts my markdown content into fast-loading HTML
  - Uses Nunjucks templating for layouts
  - Custom date formatting filters
  - Automatic asset handling
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS: The latest long-term support version of Ubuntu as my development platform

## Challenges and Solutions
During the development process, I encountered several interesting challenges:
1. Cursor AI Setup: Initially faced issues running Cursor AI on Ubuntu, solved by using the --no-sandbox option
2. Development Environment: Had to properly configure the local development environment for Eleventy
   - Set up proper file watching for live reload
   - Configured asset passthrough copying
   - Implemented custom date formatting
3. Content Migration: Needed to maintain consistency while updating the content structure
   - Created standardized frontmatter format
   - Implemented consistent category and tag structure
   - Set up proper URL slugging

## Future Improvements
Here are some features and improvements I'm planning to add:
- Automate the deployment process further
  - Implement GitHub Actions for CI/CD
  - Add automatic image optimization
- Integrate more AI-powered content suggestions
  - Explore Cursor AI's advanced features
  - Add automated code quality checks
- Add better image optimization and lazy loading
  - Implement responsive images
  - Add WebP format support

## Conclusion
This journey has taught me a lot about modern web development tools and AI integration. While there were initial challenges, the resulting workflow is much more efficient and enjoyable. I'm looking forward to exploring more AI-powered development tools and continuing to improve my site.
