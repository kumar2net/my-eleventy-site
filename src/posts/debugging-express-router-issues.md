# Debugging Express.js Router Issues: A Case Study

Recently, I encountered an interesting issue while setting up a blog analytics server using Express.js. The error message was particularly puzzling:

```
TypeError: Missing parameter name at 1: https://git.new/pathToRegexpError
```

This error was coming from an unexpected source: `node_modules/router/node_modules/path-to-regexp`. Let me walk you through the debugging process and the lessons learned.

## The Initial Setup

The server was a simple Express.js application with a few API endpoints:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/api/stats', (req, res) => {
    res.json(agent.getPostStats());
});

app.get('/api/recent', (req, res) => {
    res.json(agent.getRecentPosts(5));
});

// ... more endpoints
```

## The Problem

Despite having a straightforward Express.js setup, the server kept throwing errors related to route parameter parsing. The error stack trace pointed to a `router` package that wasn't explicitly installed or used in the code.

## The Investigation

1. **First Attempt**: Modified route parameters
   - Changed URL parameters to query parameters
   - Updated frontend code accordingly
   - Result: Error persisted

2. **Second Attempt**: Cleaned up dependencies
   - Removed `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`
   - Reinstalled all dependencies
   - Result: Error persisted

3. **Dependency Analysis**
   ```bash
   npm ls router
   ```
   This revealed something interesting:
   ```
   my-eleventy-site@1.0.0
   └─┬ express@5.1.0
     └── router@2.2.0
   ```

## The Root Cause

The issue stemmed from using Express.js version 5.1.0, which is still in beta. This version was pulling in a separate `router` package as a dependency, which was causing conflicts with Express's built-in routing system.

## The Solution

The fix was surprisingly simple: downgrade to a stable version of Express.js.

```bash
npm install express@4.18.2
```

This resolved the issue because:
1. Express 4.x uses its own internal routing system
2. It doesn't depend on external router packages
3. It's a stable, well-tested version

## Lessons Learned

1. **Version Management**
   - Be cautious with beta versions in production
   - Always check the stability of dependencies
   - Consider using specific version numbers rather than ranges

2. **Dependency Investigation**
   - Use `npm ls` to understand dependency trees
   - Check for unexpected sub-dependencies
   - Look for package conflicts

3. **Debugging Strategy**
   - Start with the error message
   - Trace through the dependency chain
   - Consider both direct and indirect dependencies

## Best Practices

1. **For Express.js Projects**
   - Use stable versions (4.x) for production
   - Test beta versions (5.x) in development only
   - Keep dependencies up to date but within stable ranges

2. **For Dependency Management**
   - Regularly audit dependencies
   - Use `package-lock.json` for consistent installs
   - Consider using `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities

## Conclusion

This debugging journey highlights the importance of understanding your project's dependency tree and being cautious with beta versions. Sometimes, the solution isn't in the code itself but in the tools and versions we choose to use.

Remember: When dealing with framework-related issues, always check:
1. The version you're using
2. The dependency tree
3. Known issues in the version
4. Alternative stable versions

Happy coding!
