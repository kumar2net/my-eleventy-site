The reasons: - This move will recharge the complete wireless and Internet eco-systems players - Silicon (RFIC, Baseband ...), device manufacturers, infra vendors, application developers et al and push them to innovate
- Lower frequency band and hence better indoor penetration (~ 90% of all mobile broadband internet access is done from inside a building) - Un-licensed spectrum - affordable rural mobile broadband access at low ARPU's and could lead to Digital Inclusion.
