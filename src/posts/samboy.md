<p>His colleague Mr. Ayya Kutty whom I happen to know - we played tennis at our colony ground,  spoke highly of Sam. He said Sam was his boss - Sales Director and he Manager Admin &amp; Sales - they both worked in Alembic Bangalore for close to 3 years and became close buddies. He rose from a tyro Medical Representative - MR of yore to Sales Director position and travelled extensively to the length and breadth of the country.  They the ex. Colleagues gang still get together and don't miss to see his moves to that Entammede Jimmiki Kammal üï∫</p>

<p>We all wished him well and I am üíØ percent sure everyone will be in touch with him for long - as he touched us all in a unique way and has a lot to share. He doesn't miss to say how much he likes to be in the midst of our üéæ gang - all ages from teen to Fiftees and still been able to flex his forehead  cross court passing shot. He used to trouble me during KTC/ MPTA days by tilting his ever shining, well oiled head and reflect the early morning Sun ‚òÄÔ∏è rays and blind me when I played as opponent</p>
