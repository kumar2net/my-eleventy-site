It is impressive to note that the net month-on-month mobile addition (connections) now clock 9 Million per month in India: GSM + CDMA = 305.23 Million connections Wireline (landline) = 38.63 Million connections. \[gallery\] While the Voice part of the mobile business is doing good, things aren't looking good on the Data front. Only 3% of mobile user base have subscribed for data (mobile internet and open garden ). I am sure the following mix of network and content will help advance the case for mobile internet in India:

-   3G networks - HSPA/WCDMA/LTE to boost capacity per base station
-   quality mobile specific content
-   vibrant eco-system where-in the mobile operator gives majority of the revenue share ( > 80%) for mobile specific content to the developer
