<p>When the weekend kicks in, the buzz with parents dropping off kids for sports- tennis, table tennis, badminton, archery or Silambam சிலம்பம் training is something that impresses me very much. I always believed that learning proper technique is very important. Once you are adept at one racquet sport, others can be picked up with little effort. But there are some things we need to keep in mind - in shuttle badminton you use the wrist to flick but in tennis you wouldn't use it,  rather the effort should be from the shoulder and body forward thrust. The high toss &amp; elbow bend during serves are basic but ONLY with repeated practice, it all gets into 💪 memory</p>
