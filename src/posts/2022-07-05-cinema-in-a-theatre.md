It's a long long time really. Since I had visited ISRO ( Indian Space Centre Organisation) centres at SHAR, Sriharikota & LPSC Valiamala, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala during my work life, this one: Rocketry - The Nambi Effect is a must see for me.

We went with Mythily to SPI cinemas - now PVR at Brookfields Mall, Coimbatore

Solid Propulsion, Liquid Propulsion, Cryogenic engines are some technical stuff I could relate to. That Madhavan R had taken this kind of subject and directed it too deserves a lot of appreciation

Nice ambience at theatre and Brookfields mall is posh and one of the largest food courts in a mall that i had seen thus far. Of course I had my burrito at Taco's

We got stuck in a massive traffic snarl near Perur when getting back home and had to navigate through narrow lanes to get around the vehicle pileups

So I would recommend that you give it a watch too üçøüé¶
