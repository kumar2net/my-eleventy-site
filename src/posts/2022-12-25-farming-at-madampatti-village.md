I believed Red soil means Fertile and that's how it looks here

But I was quite surprised at the amount of Fertilizer the farmer used. He also sprays pesticides very often. The stench from the fertilizer is a bit unbearable though

![From barren land to fledgling crop in a few months]

The steps I noticed: - The farmer Used JCB to take out the massive weeds
- Used Tiller to soften the soil
- Laid micro irrigation pipelines neatly
- Womenfolk Planted the banana stems வாழ தண்டு of 4 to 6 inches at intervals
- Then Fertilizing & Pesticiding

Why isn't the organic farming techniques espoused by Nammalvar practised here?
Maybe they find them unviable cost wise and hence use chemical based ones
