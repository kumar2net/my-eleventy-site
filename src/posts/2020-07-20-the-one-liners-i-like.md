![] (/assets/images/the-one-liners-i-like-69c4cf9a. jpg) - Be the change you want to see
- Connect the dots
- This too shall pass
- Let things flow
- Try not convert thought to thinking unnecessarily
- Past is passed and see what is to be done
- Experience and Experiencer are the same
- Be as you are
- No way out
- Experience is God
- Nothing to attain in phychological world
- Just do it
- Understanding the inability of intelligence is enlightenment
- A ship in harbour is safe but that's not what it is built for
- Aham Brahmasmi
