In the fast paced world with less and less time available to us, we can use this trick. Suppose if we want someone to listen to part/ snippet of the video which is for few minutes duration only there is a way to do i
t. We basically modify the youtube url/ link by passing the start and end time in second
s. 1. Original youtube url: **https: //yout
u. be/qqpOS4VMdhQ**
2. When you play the video in Youtube app or in browser - Chrome, Firefox etc.. it is for
 40. 45 - 40 minute 45 seconds

3. Now let us say the key part you want someone to listen is from
 1. 03 to
 7. 28 minutes

4. convert the above start and end time to**seconds**only parameter

start time in seconds only = start minutes \* 60 + start seconds

start minutes

start seconds

end minutes

end seconds

start in sec only

end in sec only

1

3

7

28

63

448

1 \*60 + 3 = 63 seconds

5\. Next we compose the link as follows: a. type as per the below

https: //www. youtub
e. com/embed/

b. then cut and paste the video link after / in the original url
- *qqpOS4VMdhQ**c. append to 5. a which we typed in keyboard: https: //ww
w. youtub
e. com/embed/**qqpOS4VMdhQ**

6\. now we type ? and then input the start and end times as below with ampersand in between: [https: //www. youtub
e. com/embed/qqpOS4VMdhQ?start=63&end=443] (https: //ww
w. youtub
e. com/embed/qqpOS4VMdhQ?start=63&end=443) 7\. if you now click on the link it will start at the start time of 1. 03 minute and end at
 7. 28 minutes

8\. There will work well in our laptop/desktop browsers but when use our mobile/smartphone there is an inconsistency. There is a workaround for tha
t.

9\. Open the link in Chrome/Firefox or any other browser in mobile phone instead of Youtube app

10\. in the mobile phone browser setting select 'Desktop site' as per below screenshot - click on 3 dots and click/tick mark on 'Desktop Site'

Happy viewing
