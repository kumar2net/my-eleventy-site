When asked - What do you want me to get for you from Luanda? I thought a bit and said raw cocoa powder, since I was fresh from watching a documentary about exploitation of African child labor by multinational chocolate companies. So I requested that the pack has 'made in Africa' label on it

Mind you the raw cocoa powder is 10x bitter than the typical dark chocolate üç´

I wanted to make a cold cocoa drink but found it hard to mix the powder which just floated on the surface

Then I hit on the idea - what our gym boys use for protein shakes and viola my issue is fixed and got my frothing drink. The gooseberry seed shaped ball is the secret part of the shaker and does give a whirl
