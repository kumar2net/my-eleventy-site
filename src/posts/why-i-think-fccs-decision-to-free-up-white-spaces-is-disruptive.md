The reasons:
<ul>
	<li>This move will recharge the complete wireless and Internet eco-systems players - Silicon (RFIC, Baseband ...), device manufacturers, infra vendors, application developers et al and push them to innovate</li>
	<li>Lower frequency band and hence better indoor penetration ( ~ 90% of all mobile broadband internet access is done from inside a building)</li>
	<li>Un-licensed spectrum - affordable rural mobile broadband access at low ARPU's and could lead to Digital Inclusion.</li>
</ul>
