Got a call from Manchester club yesterday evening that 7-8 am slot is open and was overjoyed. Played 2 competitive sets this morning with my new Yonex ArcSaber Taufik Hidayak racquet 🎾 I requested the club owner to try and put in a table tennis facility as I know there are a couple of good players in the community with whom I can spar with 🏓

Brilliant colors with a dash of herbal in Durai's flower decor today. Neem leaves as bed gives it a divine look too
